## About Laravel

Avalanche Calculator (despite the name), is a collection of self-help tools for debt, with the main focus being on the Avalanche & Snowball Forecast Calculations. There are a few guidelines that I intend to follow:

- Quick & Easy UI/UX
- Full Transparency
- Completely Free
- Open Source, feel free to suggest contributions!
- Privacy Oriented, users are always in full control of their data

The website uses [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) as the base framework.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute! Whether you've found a typo, fixed a bug, offer a new feature or wrote a language pack, everyone is welcome to contribute so long it improves end-user experience.
